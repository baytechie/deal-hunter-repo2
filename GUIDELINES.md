# Project Guidelines & Rules

This document contains all style guides, rules, and design guidelines for the DealHunter project.

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- **Always create a feature branch** for code changes (e.g., `feature/add-login`, `fix/api-error`)
- Merge feature branches to `main` after completion
- Push changes to remote after merging

### Exceptions
- Documentation and guideline updates can be committed directly to `main`
