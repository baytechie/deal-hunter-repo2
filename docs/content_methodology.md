# Deal Hunt Content Methodology

## Overview

This document explains how Deal Hunt analyzes and recommends products to our users. Our methodology is designed to provide honest, useful recommendations while complying with Amazon Associates and FTC guidelines.

## Our Analysis Process

### 1. Deal Discovery

We discover deals through multiple channels:
- Automated price monitoring across major retailers
- RSS feeds from retailer deal pages
- Manual curation by our editorial team
- Community submissions (coming soon)

### 2. Price Analysis

For each deal, we analyze:
- **Current Price**: The price at the time of posting
- **Original Price**: The regular/list price
- **Discount Percentage**: Calculated savings
- **Price History**: Historical pricing data when available
- **Price Trend**: Whether the current price is above/below average

### 3. Editorial Analysis

Our team writes original analysis for featured deals, including:

#### Original Analysis (50-150 words)
Each featured deal includes unique editorial content that:
- Explains why this is (or isn't) a good deal
- Compares to historical prices when available
- Notes any caveats or considerations
- Provides context about the product or category

#### Pros and Cons
We list specific advantages and disadvantages:
- **Pros**: Tangible benefits like free shipping, warranty, quality
- **Cons**: Honest limitations like limited colors, no returns, etc.

#### Expert Verdict
We assign one of three verdicts:
- **BUY NOW**: Excellent value, buy with confidence
- **WAIT**: Good but not great; better deals may come
- **PASS**: Not recommended at current price

#### When to Buy
Timing recommendations based on:
- Seasonal pricing patterns
- Upcoming sales events
- Historical low prices

#### Best For
Target audience descriptions to help users self-select:
- "Budget-conscious shoppers"
- "Tech enthusiasts who need the latest"
- "Parents looking for durable options"
